# Bug Reports

## 1. The form field accepts white space
- **Description:**
  - The form fields (e.g., first name, last name, email, etc.) currently accept input that consists only of white space characters.
- **Expected Behavior:**
  - Validation should be triggered immediately (on blur or input), and an error message should be shown without requiring the user to click the "Create Account" button.
- **Actual Behavior:**
  - No validation is shown for white space-only input until the form is submitted.
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Enter only spaces in any required form field.
  2. Move focus away from the field.
  3. Observe that no validation error is shown.

## 2. The form field accepts duplicate phone numbers
- **Description:**
  - The phone number field allows users to enter a phone number that is already registered in the system.
- **Expected Behavior:**
  - The system should check for uniqueness of the phone number and display a validation error if the number is already in use.
- **Actual Behavior:**
  - Duplicate phone numbers can be submitted and accepted.
- **Improvement Suggestion:**
  - Implement a uniqueness check for the phone number field and show an appropriate error message if a duplicate is detected.

## 3. The form field accepts duplicate passwords
- **Description:**
  - The password field allows users to choose a password that has already been used by another account.
- **Expected Behavior:**
  - A validation error should be shown: "This password is already chosen, please select a new one."
- **Actual Behavior:**
  - Duplicate passwords are accepted without any warning or validation error.
- **Improvement Suggestion:**
  - Add a check for password uniqueness and display the specified error message if a duplicate is detected.

## 4. The form field accepts passwords longer than 32 characters
- **Description:**
  - The password field currently allows users to enter passwords longer than 32 characters where the password satifies all the given condition (atleast one upper case, one lower case and number).
- **Expected Behavior:**
  - The password should be validated to ensure it is between 12 and 32 characters in length. An error message should be shown if the password exceeds 32 characters.
- **Actual Behavior:**
  - Passwords longer than 32 characters are accepted without any validation error.
- **Improvement Suggestion:**
  - Add validation to restrict the password length to a maximum of 32 characters and display an appropriate error message if exceeded.
